Facepager was made for fetching public available data from YouTube, Twitter and other websites on the basis of APIs and webscraping. All data is stored in a SQLite database and may be exported to csv. 

### Installer

Installation packages for each version are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/strohne/Facepager/releases). Database files may be incompatible between versions.

- **Windows**: Download and execute the latest exe-installer from the [releases page](https://github.com/strohne/Facepager/releases). 
  If Windows complains about an unknown publisher and refuses to launch the app click "More info" and start anyway.
- **Mac OS X**: Download and install the latest package from the [releases page](https://github.com/strohne/Facepager/releases). 
  Your computer will complain that it can't install the package, see https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac for further information. 
  Head to the "System Settings", then click "Privacy & Security" in the sidebar.

  Older versions of Facepager were distributed in zip files and not code signed. Download and unzip the file from the releases page, drag & drop the app to your "Applications" folder.
