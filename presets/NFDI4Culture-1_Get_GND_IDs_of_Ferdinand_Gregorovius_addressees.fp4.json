  "name": "1 Get GND IDs of Ferdinand Gregorovius' addressees",
  "category": "NFDI4Culture",
  "description": "This preset accompanies our [Getting Started with Culture Knowledge Graph](https://github.com/strohne/Facepager/wiki/Getting-Started-with-CultureKnowledgeGraph) guide.  \n\nIt retrives GND IDs of Ferdinand Gregorovius' addressees based on years as seed nodes. At the heart of the preset lies a SPARQL query. Making an effort to learn the basics of SPARQL's syntax will allow you to literally understand any such query and, more crucially, let's you write your own queries, thus empowering you to answer (research) questions of your interest. A great resources to start with is, for example, [Wikidata's introduction to SPARQL](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_tutorial). For now, it will suffice to understand that the query returns the url, label, and date of any letter Gregorovius wrote during the specfied year as well as the GND IDs of all persons addressed or mention in each letter.\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** The Culture Knowledge Graph is work in progress. Currently, only a handful of datasets are accessible through its SPARQL endpoint using the NFDI4Culture Ontology. The User-Policy and guidelines of the Culture Knowledge Graph are being worked on as well. For the time being we advise you to be mindful of potential query limits.",
