  "category": "Bibliometrics",
  "description": "[The OpenCitations Index](https://opencitations.net/index) – formerly known as the OpenCitations Index of Crossref open DOI-to-DOI citations (COCI) – is a bibliographic index recording and storing citations between publications. It pulls its data from various open scholarly sources as described on their website (see link above), thereby providing comprehensive and openly accessible bibliographic and citation data. \n\nEach citation is identified by an unique [Open Citation Identifier (OCI)](https://identifiers.org/oci). However, data can be fetched via various identifiers including DOIs. \n\nApply this preset to fetch metadate releated to a scholarly work.  Add as many DOIs as seed nodes as you wish (e.g. , \"10.1111/j.1460-2466.2008.01401.x\").\n\nFor this specific preset we are still calling version 1.4.0 of the [REST API for COCI](https://opencitations.net/index/coci/api/v1#/metadata/%7Bdois%7D). As the operation \"/metadata/{dois}\" has not been carried to version 2.0.x of [the REST API for the OpenCitations Index](https://opencitations.net/index/api/v2). In this context OpenCitations states: \"we use certain legacy APIs for historical and compatibility reasons. While we encourage the use of our latest and more efficient V2 APIs, we understand that some applications may still rely on these older endpoints. Please note that legacy APIs may not receive updates or support, and their use may be phased out in the future. We recommend transitioning to our current V2 APIs for improved performance, security, and reliability.\"",
