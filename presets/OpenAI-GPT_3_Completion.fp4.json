  "description": "**This preset was developed for the beta versions of the OpenAI API. You might want to try the newer responses API**\n\nText completion with GPT-3 lets you predict what comes next after a given text. Add a prompt as a seed node, enter your access token (see below) and fetch data.\n\n**Authorization**\n \nOpenAI\u2019s API provides access to GPT-3. In order to use the OpenAI API, you need to register on https://openai.com/api/. After registration, you will find a secret API key in your account settings (https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys). In Facepager, enter the key into the access token field. *Note*: You need to pay for using the API, however, as a new user you get free credits for trial purposes.\n\n\n**Get started with the preset**\n \n1. After creating or opening a database, add a seed node with your prompt, e.g. \u201cSay this is a test\u201d using the \"Add Nodes\" button. \n\n2. Load the preset by clicking \"Apply\" in the preset window. \n\n3. Login to OpenAI, find your secret API key and put it into the access token field of Facepager.\n\n4. Select the seed node and finally click \u201cFetch Data\u201d.\n\n**Further Options**\n\nWithin the payload field, you can customize the query.\n\n*prompt*: The placeholder <Object ID> is replaced by you node data. Thus, add your prompts as  seed nodes.\n\n*temperature*: Defines the sampling temperature. Higher values indicate riskier (or more creative) predictions. \n\n*max_tokens*: The maximal tokens (=words) the model returns. Each model has a context length that cannot be exceed (e.g. 4000 tokens with the Davinci model). \n\nGPT 3 is powered by four models for different purposes: ada, davinci, curie, babbage, see https://beta.openai.com/docs/engines/overview. This preset uses Davinci as defined in the base path.\n\nFor more options see the API documentation: https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions.\n",
