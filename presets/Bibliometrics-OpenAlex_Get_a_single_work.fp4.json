  "description": "OpenAlex (https://openalex.org/about) is a free and open online repository of the world's research system. It includes works, authors, sources, concepts, institutions, publishers, funders, and their interconnections. As an open-source project, it requires no authentication. Each user is allowed a maximum of 100,000 API calls per day. If you need a higher limit, you can register for OpenAlex Premium (https://openalex.org/pricing).\n\nThis preset allows you to retrieve a single academic work with a DOI (e.g., https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4375 \ufffc), an OpenAlex ID (e.g., W2741809807), or a PubMed ID (e.g., https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14907713) as a seed node.\n\nYou can select specific fields to narrow your query. In this preset, id, doi, title, publication_year, authorships and referenced_works are returned in the results. \n\nIf you want to fetch other information about a single work (e.g., citation count), have a look at the documentation (https://docs.openalex.org/api-entities/works/work-object). OpenAlex provides a vast amount of information relevant to the research.",
