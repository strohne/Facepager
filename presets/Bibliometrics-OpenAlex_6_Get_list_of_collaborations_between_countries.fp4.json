  "category": "Bibliometrics",
  "description": "This preset accompanies the sixth tutorial of our [Getting Started with OpenAlex](https://github.com/strohne/Facepager/wiki/Getting-Started-with-OpenAlex) guide.  \n\nIt retrieves a list of scholarly works based on one or more arbitrary search terms refined by the use of geographical filters. To begin, add a seed node (e.g., colonialism) to receive works that at least one author from a Brazilian institution as well as at least one author from a Portuguese institution has contributed and that contains this text string in their title, abstract, or full-text. For now the preset limits the number of calls to 100. Up the *per-page* parameter to fetch more. \n\nThe results are sorted by their publication date. Of course that is only one way to arrange the results. Refer to [OpenAlex' documentation](https://docs.openalex.org/how-to-use-the-api/get-lists-of-entities/sort-entity-lists) to learn about your options.\n\nTo obtain the metadata of any work, apply the \"OpenAlex: Get a single work\" preset, select the node(s) of interest, and hit Fetch data once more. \n\nPlease note that each user is allowed a maximum of 100,000 API calls per day and 10 API calls per second. If you need a higher limit, you can register for [OpenAlex Premium](https://openalex.org/pricing).",
