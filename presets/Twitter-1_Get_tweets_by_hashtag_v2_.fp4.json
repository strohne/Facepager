  "description": "The free pre-registered accesses no longer work. Fetching Twitter data with Facepager is only possible after setting up a paid v2 access (https://developer.twitter.com/en). This preset searches tweets. Add any search term as seed node. You can, for example, search for hashtags (starting with #) and users (starting with @).\n\n**Login Process**\n\n*To use version 2 presets, you have to register an own app, which is easy. An app is nothing more than a specific user account. See below.* \n\nOnce your app is registered (whether the essential version or in the academic research track), you will get an API key and an API secret key. You have to keep these well and should not show them to anyone.\n\nTo use your credentials with Facepager, click on \"Settings\" and change the \"Authentication Type\" to \"OAuth2 Client Credentials\". Enter your personal API key into the \"Consumer Key\" field and your API secret key into the \"Consumer Secret\" field. \n\nClick the \"Login to Twitter\" button to get an access token. Then you can start fetching data.\n\n**Get those tweets**\n\nThe preset gives you back the 100 most recent tweets matching the query, see the max_results parameter. For academic research projects, the limit can be increased to 500 per query. To get multiple pages of results, increase the maximum pages option.\n\nThe preset comes with lots of parameters, because you have to explicitly specify which data you want to retrieve. You can simplify the query by omitting all parameters except \"query\".\n\nTake a look at the documentation on https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/api-reference/get-tweets-search-recent to learn handling the parameters.\n\n**Differences between v1.1 & v2**\n\nPlease remind that Twitter provides different API versions (https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api). Facepager presets are available for API version 1 (v1) and for API version 2 (v2). Each API version has different access levels and limits. To use version 2, in general, you have to register your own app. Registering an app sounds complicated but is easy. In the world of APIs, an app simply is a specific type of user account.\n\nWhen registering an app, you can apply for different access levels, see https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api. \nAcademic researchers can apply for higher tweet caps or full-archive access, see https://developer.twitter.com/en/solutions/academic-research.",
