  "description": "OpenAlex (https://openalex.org/about) is a free and open online repository of the world's research system. It includes works, authors, sources, concepts, institutions, publishers, funders, and their interconnections. As an open-source project, it requires no authentication. Each user is allowed a maximum of 100,000 API calls per day. If you need a higher limit, you can register for OpenAlex Premium (https://openalex.org/pricing). \n\nThis preset allows you to get a list of authors filtered by certain criteria. In this preset you get an author list based on their last_known_institution. Therefore you need the last_known_institution.id. You can get it by applying preset \u201cGet author\u201d. You can use >transfer nodes< function to set last_known_institution.id as Object-ID. Simply set last_known_institution.id as key to extract. Then you retrieve all authors affiliated with a single institution. For all filter options have a look at https://docs.openalex.org/api-entities/authors/filter-authors. \n\nIn this preset the authors list is sorted by their citation count. You can also sort alphabetically or works count for example (https://docs.openalex.org/how-to-use-the-api/get-lists-of-entities/sort-entity-lists). ",
