See the preset named \"Get Facebook posts\".\n\nSee https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v2.10/comment for information about available fields.\n\nNotice: When adding fields to the fields-parameter also add them in the column setup to make the data visible in the nodes view.\n\nBy the way: you cannot access data about the author of comments (if you are not the owner of the page).",
