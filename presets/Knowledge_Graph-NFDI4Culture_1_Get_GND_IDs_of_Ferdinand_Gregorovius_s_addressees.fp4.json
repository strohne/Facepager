  "name": "NFDI4Culture: 1 Get GND IDs of Ferdinand Gregorovius's addressees",
  "category": "Knowledge Graph",
  "description": "*This preset requires at least Facepager v4.6.* \n\nThis preset retrieves GND IDs of Ferdinand Gregorovius' addressees from the Culture Knowledge Graph. To start add a year (e.g. 1851) as a seed node. Then fetch data.  \n\nAt the heart of the preset lies a SPARQL query. Making an effort to learn the basics of SPARQL's syntax will allow you to literally understand any such query and, more crucially, let's you write your own queries, thus empowering you to answer (research) questions of your interest. A great resources to start with is, for example, [Wikidata's introduction to SPARQL](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_tutorial). For now, it will suffice to understand that the query returns the url, label, and date of any letter Gregorovius wrote during the specified year as well as the GND IDs of all persons addressed or mention in each letter.  \n\nSee our [Getting Started with Culture Knowledge Graph](https://github.com/strohne/Facepager/wiki/Getting-Started-with-CultureKnowledgeGraph) for a full and beginner friendly walk through this preset.  \n\n**DISCLAIMER:** The Culture Knowledge Graph is work in progress. Currently, only a handful of datasets are accessible through its SPARQL endpoint using the NFDI4Culture Ontology. The User-Policy and guidelines of the Culture Knowledge Graph are being worked on as well. For the time being we advise you to be mindful of potential query limits.",
