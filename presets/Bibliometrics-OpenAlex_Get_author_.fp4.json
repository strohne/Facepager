  "description": "OpenAlex (https://openalex.org/about) is a free and open online repository of the world's research system. It includes works, authors, sources, concepts, institutions, publishers, funders, and their interconnections. As an open-source project, it requires no authentication. Each user is allowed a maximum of 100,000 API calls per day. If you need a higher limit, you can register for OpenAlex Premium (https://openalex.org/pricing).\n  \nThis preset allows you to get author information with OpenAlex ID (e.g. A2208157607) external IDs such as ORCID (e.g. https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1298-3089), Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) or Wikipedia. For more information have a look at https://docs.openalex.org/api-entities/authors/get-a-single-author. \n\nYou can select certain fields to narrow your query. In this preset id, orcid, display_name, works_count, cited_by_count and last_known_institution are returned in the results. If you want to fetch other information about an author (e.g. citation metrics or authors institution) have a look at the documentation (https://docs.openalex.org/api-entities/authors/author-object). OpenAlex provides a vast amount of information relevant to the author. ",
