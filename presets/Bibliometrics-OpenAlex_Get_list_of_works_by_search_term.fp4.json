  "name": "OpenAlex: Get list of works by search term",
  "category": "Bibliometrics",
  "description": "OpenAlex (https://openalex.org/about) is a free and open online repository of the world's research system. It includes works, authors, sources, concepts, institutions, publishers, funders, and their interconnections. Operating as an open-source project, it requires no authentication. Each user is allowed a maximum of 100,000 API calls per day. If you need a higher limit, you can register for OpenAlex Premium (https://openalex.org/pricing).\n\nThis preset allows you to retrieve a list of works by a search term as a seed node. For example, get all works that have \"computational methods\" (Object-ID) in the title, abstract, or fulltext. The result is a list in which each item is a new OpenAlex ID. If you want to fetch metadata for the works, apply \u201cGet a single work\u201d again.\n\nThis preset provides 100 titles; for more, increase the per-page parameter. Results are sorted by publication year. You can also sort alphabetically or by relevance score, for example. For more information, have a look at: https://docs.openalex.org/how-to-use-the-api/get-lists-of-entities/sort-entity-lists.",
